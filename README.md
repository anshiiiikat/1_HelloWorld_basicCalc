#Aim
To write a C++ program that takes two floating-point numbers as input from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

#Theory
Arithmetic operations form the foundation of any computational task. In C++, we can use standard arithmetic operators to perform mathematical calculations:

+ : Addition

- : Subtraction

* : Multiplication

/ : Division

The program uses:

cin to take input from the user.

cout to display output to the console.

Variables of float data type to store decimal values.

Basic I/O operations provided by the C++ Standard Library (iostream).

##Control Flow
The program begins by displaying a greeting.

It prompts the user to enter two floating-point numbers.

It calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient using arithmetic operators.

The results are printed to the screen using cout.

#Conclusion
The program successfully takes two numbers as input and performs all four basic arithmetic operations. It demonstrates the use of variables, user input, output statements, and arithmetic operators in C++. This helps in understanding the basic structure of a C++ program and how computation and I/O operations are handled.
